# Migrate to 25.1 

Changes:
- DB 23.5 -> 23.6
- APEX 24.1 -> 24.2

Luckily the data files are compatible with the new version. We just need to upgrade the database and APEX.

Still, we want to backup the database and the oradata volume.

## Check that db is running

```sh
docker ps 
```

Otherwise start the database.

## Switch branch

```sh
git checkout 25-1
```

## Give permission to all new scripts

```sh
chmod +x ./local-23ai.sh ./setup.sh ./scripts/*.sh
```

## Backup the database

This will backup all schemas and APEX workspaces that where created with the `local-23ai.sh create-user` script. If you have additional schemas or workspaces **you need to backup them manually**.

```sh
local-23ai.sh backup-all   
```

Now check the `backups/export` directory if the backup was created successfully.

## Backup the oradata volume

Note this can take a moment. Make sure that `./backups/oradata` does not exist.

```sh
source ./scripts/util/load_env.sh

docker exec $CONTAINER_NAME bash -c "echo 'shutdown immediate;
exit' | sqlplus / as sysdba && exit"

docker cp $CONTAINER_NAME:/opt/oracle/oradata ./backups/oradata
```

## Stop the containers

```sh
local-23ai.sh stop
```

## Create .env.ords

Create a file called `.env.ords` in the root directory with the following content:

```sh
IGNORE_APEX=TRUE
```

As ORDS does not ship with APEX 24.2 yet, we tell ORDS to ignore APEX.

## Start the containers

```sh
docker-compose up -d
```

## Upgrade APEX to 24.2

```sh
wget https://download.oracle.com/otn_software/apex/apex-latest.zip
unzip apex-latest.zip
rm apex-latest.zip
rm -rf ./META-INF || true

cd apex
sql -name local-23ai-sys @apexins.sql SYSAUX SYSAUX TEMP /i/
exit;

docker cp --archive ./images local-ords:/opt/oracle/apex/24.1.0/
```
