# Containerized APEX Development Environment

## What is this?

This set of scripts aims to make developing APEX on your local machine as easy as possible. It is a ready-to-use setup with common tasks automated as bash scripts.

- Have a 23ai with APEX and ORDS running in ~3 minutes
- Create users and workspaces with optimal settings with a single command
- All users are stored for easy access with SQLcl or VS Code SQL Developer
- Easily delete all data to test installation scripts multiple times
- Backup and restore your data, workspaces and apps
- Script to run ORDS with SSL

**This is not for production use!** I configured the environment to be unsecure to make development as easy as possible. I also run some statements that are not supported and could be dangerous. So use this at your own risk and run backups regularly.

## Pre-requisites

- Docker or Podman or any other docker compatible container runtime
  - Make sure your virtual machine has enough resources allocated. **The default Podman VM will cause issues with Oracle**. I recommend at least 4GB of RAM and 3 CPUs. [Find out more here](https://hartenfeller.dev/blog/oracle-23ai-container-wont-start-mac).
- docker-compose / podman-compose
- SQLcl + "sql" command in PATH
- Bash compatible shell (I recommend using WSL2 on Windows)

### On mac?

[Read this](./docs/podman-on-mac.md) for more information.

## Setup

- Clone this repository
- Start a terminal in the cloned directory
- Run this (change docker-compose to podman-compose if you use podman):

```sh
# setup the environment
./setup.sh

# start the containers
docker-compose up -d

# wait for ORDS to install APEX
docker logs --follow local-ords
# INFO : This container will start a service running ORDS 24.4.0 and APEX 24.1.0.
# INFO : CONN_STRING has been found in the container variables file.
# INFO : Database connection established.
# INFO : Apex is not installed on your database.
# INFO : Installing APEX on your DB please be patient.

# wait for:
# INFO : APEX has been installed.
# INFO : Configuring APEX.
# INFO : APEX_PUBLIC_USER has been configured as oracle.
# INFO : APEX ADMIN password has configured as 'Welcome_1'.
# INFO : Use below login credentials to first time login to APEX service:
#         Workspace: internal
#         User:      ADMIN
#         Password:  Welcome_1


# Run DB config script:
./scripts/after-first-db-start.sh
```

Make sure you permission to run the scripts. If you get errors, run the following command:

```sh
chmod +x ./setup.sh ./scripts/*.sh
```

### Optional: SSL

If you want to use SSL (https) run the following command:

```sh
sudo ./scripts/create-self-signed-certificates.sh
docker-compose restart ords
```

Now you can access ORDS **only** with HTTPS: https://localhost:8181/ords/_/landing.

The script will create a self-signed certificate and store it in your operating system's keychain. It is valid for 9999 days so you don't have to worry about renewing it.

Note that I only tested this on macOS. It should work on Linux as well, but if you have issues please modify the script and create a pull request.

## Stopping the containers

The containers will use some resources in the background. You can stop them with the following command:

```sh
docker-compose stop
```

## APEX

You can access any workspace with following credentials:

URL: http://localhost:8181/ords/apex
Username: admin
Password: Welcome_1

### Adding new workspace

See [create user](#create-user-and-workspace) section.

## Common tasks

**Run all scripts from the root directory of this repository.** Like `./scripts/...`.

It can help to set up an alias to quickly cd into the directory:

```sh
alias apex-docker='cd /path/to/cloned-repo'
```

### Create user and workspace

This command will create a new db schema and workspace. You can access the workspace with both the username `ADMIN` or the given schema name and the password `Welcome_1`.

```sh
./scripts/create-user.sh movies
```

If you don't want to create a workspace, you can add the `--skip_workspace` flag.

The script will do the following:

- Create a new schema with the given name
- Store the schema password in the .env file
- Save the connection with password in the connection store
  - Easy access with SQLcl or VS Code SQL Developer
  - Example sqlcl: `sql -name local-23ai-{schema_name}`
- Add all developing necessary grants to the schema
- Gives access to the datapump directories
- Create a new workspace with the schema name
  - Sets convenient settings like max session idle time to 7 days 

### Clear a schema

This is useful if you want to test install scripts multiple times. It will drop all objects in the schema.

```sh
./scripts/clear-schema.sh {schema_name}
# it will ask for confirmation
```

From experience: never run it accidentally on sys :).

### Drop a schema

This will drop the schema and all objects in it. It will also remove the user from the database.

```sh
./scripts/drop-user.sh {schema_name}
```

### Using the VS Code SQL Developer debugger

You can use the VS Code SQL Developer extension to debug your PL/SQL code. Any created user has the necessary grants to use the debugger.

- Compile your package for debug
- Set a breakpoint
- Start the debugger
- Pass your local machine IP
  - Get that with `ipconfig getifaddr en0`

### Backup

#### Backup all users

This will create a datapump dump of all users. If there is an APEX workspace it will backup both the workspace defintion and the applications in them.

```sh
./scripts/backup-all.sh
```


#### Backup a specific schema

This will create a datapump dump of the database schema. If there is an APEX workspace it will backup both the workspace defintion and the applications in it.

The files are written to the `./backups/export` directory.

```sh
./scripts/backup-schema.sh {schema_name}
```

### Import Backup

You can currently run `./scripts/import-backup.sh <schema-name>` to import a backup. Currently it does only create the user if it does not exist and import the data pump dump.

In the future I want to add the possibility to import APEX workspaces and applications. Currently I need to future out:
- What if the workspace already exists?
- What if an application with this ID already exists?

## Delete all database data

If you want to delete your current database (everything will be lost), you can run the following command:

```sh
docker-compose down
docker volume rm oradata
rm .env
```

If you follow the [setup](#setup) instructions again, you will have a fresh database.


## FAQ

### Can I modify ORDS settings?

Yes. A folder named `ords-config` will be created in the root directory. You can modify the config files there. The changes will be applied on the next restart of the ORDS container.

### How can I upgrade the database version?

This is a bit tricky. In the past datafiles were not compatible between versions. This is the reason I added the backup scripts. For the future I want to add a script that will then import everything again.

### How can I ugprade ORDS?

You can modify the `docker-compose.yml` file to use a different ORDS version. You can find the available versions [in the Oracle container registry](https://container-registry.oracle.com/ords/f?p=113).

I will also update the github repository with the latest version of ORDS.

### How can I patch APEX?

- You need a valid Oracle support account
- Go to the [APEX Downloads Page](https://www.oracle.com/tools/downloads/apex-downloads/)
- Click on Patch Set Bundle
- Login with your Oracle account and download the zip file
- Unzip the file
- Start a terminal in the directory
- Run the following command:

```sh
sql -name local-23ai-sys @catpatch.sql
```

To update the APEX images (assets):

```sh
# make sure you are in the directory of the unzipped patch directory

# change to your base version number e.g. 24.1.0 even though it is 24.1.7
#                                                        â†“ change here
docker cp --archive ./images local-ords:/opt/oracle/apex/24.1.0/

# if on podman use the podman alternative:
# podman cp --archive ./images local-ords:/opt/oracle/apex/24.1.0/

docker restart local-ords
```

Note that I still get the alert that the images are outdated even though they are not. Check if via this link: [http](http://localhost:8181/i/apex_version.js) / [https](https://localhost:8181/i/apex_version.js).

If you have any ideas on how to improve this setup, please create an issue or a pull request.

I am especially thankful for improvements to the bash scripts.

- The database team for providing an ARM image for the Oracle database
- The ORDS team for providing an ARM image for ORDS

The cherry on top would be Oracle making APEX patches free to download for everyone.
